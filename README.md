The original LJ-119 never worked to stop 096, which I was personally fine with (I thought it was funny just as a tool to die on command), so the LJ-429 Kills the user, but doesn't waste time with that un-enrage 096 stuff.
So no, it isn't the same thing as customitems LJ-119 (and I don't intend to make it work like that).
